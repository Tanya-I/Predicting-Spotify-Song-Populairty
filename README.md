# Predicting-Spotify-Song-Populairty
## Introduction/About
This project aims to predict the popularity of songs using Spotify audio features. It involves:

- Data exploration
- Preprocessing
- Application of machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression
- The dataset contains various audio features provided by Spotify for a large number of songs

## Problem definition:
- Can we build a model to predict how popular (0-100 based on streams) a song will be on Spotify using audio features like danceability, energy, and speechiness, among others?

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing
This phase includes:

- Importing necessary libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
- Loading the dataset and examining basic information like column names, data types, and missing values
- Creating various visualizations, including histograms and scatter plots, to understand the distribution of popularity scores and the relationships between audio features and popularity

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression:
   - An attempt is made to predict song popularity using Linear Regression
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained and evaluated
   - Despite efforts, the initial model yields low R^2 values, indicating poor predictive performance

2. Linear Regression with undersampling:
   - Due to the unbalanced nature of the dataset, undersampling is performed to address the imbalance between popular and unpopular songs
   - The process involves randomly sampling a subset of less popular songs to achieve a balanced dataset

3. Random Forest Regression:
   - A Random Forest Regression model is implemented to predict song popularity after undersampling
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Grid Search Cross-Validation to optimize model performance
   - The best model is trained and evaluated, showing improved predictive performance compared to Linear Regression

## Conclusion
The key points from the conclusion are:

- The dataset exhibits a skewed distribution of popularity scores, with the majority of songs having low scores, making it challenging for linear regression to effectively predict popularity
- Many features show limited correlation with the target variable, further complicating the predictive task for linear regression
- Undersampling the dataset was essential to address the imbalance, aiming to expose the model to more relevant data points
- However, even with undersampling, linear regression failed to achieve satisfactory predictive performance
- Implementing a Random Forest regression model proved to be a more effective approach, especially after undersampling
- This model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to linear regression, indicating its suitability for this prediction task
- Grid Search Cross-Validation was instrumental in optimizing the Random Forest model's performance, showcasing the importance of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning model optimization
- Comparing the performance of linear regression and Random Forest models highlighted the latter's superiority, particularly in handling complex relationships and nonlinearities in the data

## What Have We Learned?
